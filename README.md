## How It Works

- Create account via one-time login with text authentication.
- A random popular beer list is generated.
- Users will be presented with cards showcasing each beer.
- If a user wants to add a beer to their tap list, they swipe right (left to discard)
- Once the users go through the card deck, the user is presented with their updated tap list.
